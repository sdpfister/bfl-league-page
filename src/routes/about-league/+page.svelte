    <h1 class="noUnderscore">ABOUT THE BFL LEAGUE</h1>

    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>This band of misfits first came together at Free To Choose Network (FTCN), where debating starting lineups and trash-talking each other took priority over actually getting any work done. The core crew of VP of Technology Shane, Video Team Lead Charles, Graphic Designer Mike, and Shipping Manager Matt have been there since the beginning, debating draft picks and matchups instead of working. Even after Shawn and Nick fled FTCN to escape our fantasy football obsession, they stuck around the league to keep racking up losses.</p>

        <p>After six years of respectable leadership, Commissioner Shawn stepped down and passed the torch to Charles. Of course, wild conspiracy theories abounded about his sudden resignation. Some claimed he was actually forced out in a deep-state fantasy football coup. Others were convinced he was leaving to breed exotic birds full-time. My personal favorite rumor was that he abandoned his post to join a competitive log-rolling league. But really, after half a decade, Shawn was just tired of the administrative duties and extensive time commitment required of the commissioner. Handing off the reins allows him to focus on his own team and indulge in carefree trash talk with the rest of us hooligans.</p>
            
        <p>But the biggest storyline this season is the league's new expansion team, graciously bankrolled by FTCN CEO, Rob. Though new to our league, he's been begging to join the big boys for years, and we finally took pity on him. Just kidding - we just wanted his money. Hope you're ready to be the league's punching bag, Rook!</p>
            
        <p>And so another season of fantasy football madness begins. From nail-biting wins to blowout defeats, lineup blunders to waiver wire brilliance, thrilling upsets to painful choke jobs - it will be filled with equal parts joy and agony. But through all the virtual ups and downs, one thing remains constant in the BFL - the endless, ruthless heckling and trash talk amongst friends. Because win or lose, the only thing that matters is making sure everyone else goes down in flames too. May the best trash-talker prevail!</p>
